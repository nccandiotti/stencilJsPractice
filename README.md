# WebComponents & StencilJsPractice

## Why use web components

- encapsulate logic and UI
  - separation of concerns
- reusable across pages
  - only need to write logic once/don't need to worry about overlapping logic
- reusable between apps and projects

## What are web components

- "custom html elements"
- 3 important parts
  - custom HTML elements (register your own HTML tags)
  - shadow DOM
    - features to create your own DOM tree
    - manage a separate DOM node tree for your HTML elements (including scoped CSS styles )
  - template and slots
    - write HTML templates that you can add to your HTML elements
  - HTML imports (discontinued)

## Types of Custom elements

- Autonomous (more common?)
- Extended built in elements
